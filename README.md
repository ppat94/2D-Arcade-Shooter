2D Vintage Arcade Shooter Game

This is is university project where I created this 2D arcade shooter styled game which lets the user control a player spacecraft

and shoot the enemy with bullet projectiles that are particles. I have created a physics system for particles and movement such as

thrust forces. Additionally, there are sound effects and UI for overall quality of the game.
